head -numberOfLines filename  : if you are in the same directory of 
the file then this command is used for showing the first numberOfLines
of the text file 

tail -nubmerOfLines filename : opposite to head 

nl (nubmer lines) : used for displaying text files with numbered lines  

grep -B numberOFLines : shows a number of lines before the found line 

sed s/mysql/MySQL/g snort.conf > snort2.conf : the sed stands for stream
editor and it changes the word mysql to the word MySQL in the file 
snort.conf and then renames the file to snort2.conf 
s stands for search 
g stands for globaly "which is the whole file" 
if you don't inlcude the g command then it's going to only replace the 
first instance of the mysql in the text file 
if you want to replace a specific occurence of the word like the second
occurence then just place 2 instead of g 

more sonrt.conf : displays the whole text file in a style of a page like 
man 

less snort.conf : does the same as more but it's more powerful and faster in 
opening up files and it lets you search for whatever you want by pressing /
and then what you want to search for 
if you press n "stands for next" then you can see the next occurence of your search

ifconfig : allows you to interact with active network interfaces 

ifconfig eth0 192.168.171.116 netmask 255.255.0.0 broadcast 192.168.1.255: changes your ip address for the eth0 interface to be 
this address and makes your netmask this address and your broadcast to be this address


ifconfig eth0 down
ifconfig eth0 hw ether 00:11:22:33:44:55
ifconfig eth0 up 
this brings the interface down first and then changes it's mac address to be this address
then brings back up the ethernet connection with the new mac address 

dhclient eth0 : assigns a new ip address to the eth0 interface using a DHCP server 

dig hackers-arise.com ns : is used for targeting the dns server of this domain 
ns stands for name server which is what translates the website name into an ip address
and overall this command is used to find the name servers of this domain 
if you replace the ns with mx "short for mail exchange server) it will show you 
the email servers associated with this website 

apt : Advanced Packiging Tool 

apt-cache search keyword : search in your repository for a packeage named keyword

apt-get install package name : goes the the get directory and installs the package 

apt-get remove snort : removes snort from the get directory 

apt-get purge snort : removes snort and it's configuration files 

apt-get update : updates the your get repository with new packages 

apt-get upgrade : updates your repository existing packages 

you can install a software with a gui like synaptic 

you can install repositories from git using git clone 

chown : stands for change owner 

chown bob /tmp/bobsfile : this changes the permissions so that bob now owns the file

chgrp : stands for change group 

chgrp security newIds : this changes the permissions of newids to be accessible to the 
group security 

/user/share/hashcat : is a password cracking tool

ls -l : can show you the premissions granted for each file 

the permissions of files we have are the permission to read , permission to write and 
permission to execute 

if you ls -l a directory you are going to see this 
drwx-xr-x t root root 4094 dec5 charsets
d is the file type "directory here" and - if it's a file 
rwx : are the permission of the root which are write ,execute and , read
xr: permissions of the groups which is read and execute here
x: is the permission of the user which is execute here
5 : is the number of links
root : is the owner
4095: is the size
the date : is when the file was created or last modified 
charesets : is the name of the file 

chmod 774 hashcat.hcstat changes the permission to be 
rwx for root 
rwx for groups 
r-- for users 

the numbers syntax for permissions of the is called the numeric method 

there is another method for writing the permissions of files while is the UGO 
stands for User ,Owner ,group method

chmod u-w,u+r hashcat.hcstat : which removes the write permission from the user 
if you want to add the permission change - to + 
if you want to write all the permissions granted to a user use the = sign 

by default all files and directories in linux permissions whise are 666 and 777

rwx : those are called general purpose permissions 

special permissions are SUID AND SGID which stands for set user id and set group id 

/etc/shadow : this directory has all the users passwords on linux

SUID : allows user to execute file under the owner's permission only and to do that 
inlcude the number 4 before your general purpose permissions like this 4644

SGID : if this bit is set then the whole group who has the permissions may execute the file
if group individuals don't have the permission to execute it and you have to include 2 
befor the general purpose permissions

sticky bit : a permission that allows users to change the name or delete files within
a directory but no one uses it anymore 


find / -user root -perm -4000 : this finds all the files under the / directory where 
the owner is root and the permissions of the file is -4000

if you see something like this rwsr , that means that the SUID bit is set 

ps : shows you currently active processes that you started as a user

ps aux : shows all the processes running by the system not only those started by the user 

top : displays processes that are taking most of the hardware 

PID: Process ID 

nice : lets you determine the priorty of processes with -20 being the heighst and +19 
being the lowest

renice : lets you alter the value of the priority that you gave to a process and sets 
it as an absloute level for example
renice 20 4888 "PID"

nice -n -10 /bin/slowprocess : this increments the priority of the process to be -10 
which is fairyly high

zombie process : is a process that is consuming a lot of resources and exhibit a strange
behaviour and maybe even freeze

kill -3 PID : this kills a process and sends it's information to the disk drive

kill -9 PID : this completely kills a process

killall -9 processname : kills all the processes that have that name immediately 

& : is for starting a process in the background like this leafpad newscript & 

fg PID : moves a process to the ForeGround

at : is a command that tells a process when to run once and for all like this 
at 7:20pm 

crond : is a command that tells a process of when to run repeatedly in the future like 
once a week or once a month

there are two types of variables in linux , environment variables and shell varibles 
environment variables control how the system acts and feels to the user and the proccesses
under it inherit it's proprties but shell variables are specific for the shells that they
are used in 
note : variables are key-value pairs like this key=value

set | grep HISTSIZE : will show you how many commands that the shell stores 
HISTSIZE=0 : changes the number of commands that the bash shows to be 0

export HISTSIZE : this command stores the HISTSIZE forever in this case it's going to be 0

ps1 variable : is an environment variable that is the user name that appears in the 
shell prompt like root@kali by doing PS1="HELLO"

most of the commands that we run on the shell are found in the bin or sbin directory 

echo $PATH : shows you which path your commands are installed in 

PATH=$PATH:/root/newhackingtool this adds the new hacking tool folder to your paths so that 
you can use it later 

HELLO="SHIT SHIT" : this creates a new user variable that has this value

echo $variable : shows the value that the variable holds

unset variable : this deletes a variable 

#!/bin/bash : allows you to use the interpreter in bash

./program : to execute program 

read varaible : allows you to take variable value from the user
$variable : allows you to display the variable value 

nmap : is a tool that allows for you to know which ports are opened in a system that you
are targeting 
and this acutally allows you to know what processes are working on the system

nmap -sT ip address : allows you to do a TCP scan on ip address

nmap -sT ip address -p port number : this allows you to check wether a specific port 
is open or not for example -p 3306 is mysql port

nmap -sT ip address-last octet of another ip address : scans a specific range of ip addresses

lossy compression : is a compression that changes the file to a smaller one but by changing
some of it's characterestics without being noticed by the user 

Tar : tape archive refrencing the old days when tapes where used to store data 

tar -cvf : where c stands for create , v stands for verbose , f stands for right to the 
following file 
tar -cvf haker.tar hack hack1 : this COMBINES those two files in haker.tar

tar -tvf haker.tar : shows you what's inside of that tar and t stands for content list

tar -xvf haker.tar : extracts the file and -x stands for extract

three tools for COMPRESSION with three different extensions 
gzip , .tar,.gz,.tgz falls in between bzip and compress
bzip2 , .tar.bz2 is the slowest but with the least size resultant file
compress , .tar.z is the fastest but with a larger compression than the original files

gzip file : let's you compress the file 

gunzip file : let's you decompress the file and this can be used with .zip files

bzip2 file : compresses this file
bunzip2 file : decompresses the file 

same applies to compress

dd if=/dev/sdb of=/root/flashcopy bs = 4095 conv:noerror: copies sdb folder to flashcopy 
folder bit by bit and even with the deleted files and bs specefies the sector of copying
and conv:noerror continues copying even if there is some error encountered

sda sda1 sdb : that means that you have two drives , sda and sdb and sda is split into 
two sections or partitions

fdisk -l  : shows you the partitions of your disk and how much space is allocated to each

lsblk : stands for list block devices and it shows you your hard drives and their sections

mounting : is a term that stands for appending external data storage devices on the file 
system , usually hard drives and mounted at /mnt and usb drives are mounted at /media

mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt : this mounts a device to the folder /mnt

unmount /dev/sdb1 : ejects the hard drive from the pc

fsck : file system check checks for bad parts in the system 

rsyslog.conf : a file in etc which shows you the rules set for the system 

shred -f : allows you to delete a file permanently , even a forensic investigator wouldn't
be able to recover it 

service ServiceName option : if you would like to restart , shutdown or even start 
a servce you do it like the previous format example:
service rsyslog stop

SSH : Secure Shell

Raspberry pi : a small sized pc that is perfect for spying

mysql -u root -p 192.168.1.1 : this remotely accesses the database of another machine

use database name : allows you to switch databases to a specific one 

proxychains <the command you want proxied><arguments>: allow you to hide your traffic 

proxychains nmap sT -pn 191.178.1.1 : this hide the fact that you are scanning this website

proxychains firefox website : opens a website using your proxy not your ip 

iwlist wlan0 scan : scans for available networks
