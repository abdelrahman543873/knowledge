fvlsi : is a process of putting a lot of circuits in a chip 

each hexadecimal bit is called represents four binary bits 

stream : a string of binary bits 

cells : are parts of the main memory that are programmable to zero and one and typically each cell contains a 
byte or 8 bits

that changes the number of bits to an odd number so that if an even number of ones is encountered that means that
the stream has been manipulated

run-length encoding : is a loseless method of compression by replacing repeated items by a code representing 
this repetetion 

frequency-dependent encoding : also named as hufman-codes which depends on the frequency of repetion of the item 
in the coded manner 

differential or relative encoding : is used for compressing items that are closely related like the frames of a
video by finding the relation between those frames insted of saving the whole frame and it could be losy or loseless
depeding on if the data to be approxmated or strictly required

dictionary encoding : which is depending of finding the constitutents of the data to be compressed and then 
relating the actual data to the dictionary items and it can be lossy cause sometimes the dictionary elements are consititued 

adaptive dictionary encoding or LZW : is a way of encoding data by creating specific dictionaries according to the
message itself

GIF : Graphic Interchange Format which depends on individual pixel color 

JPEG : mostly uses the limitation of the human eyes that are able to identify brightness change more than color
change and then it decresses the color accuracy which cause more compression wihout visual obvious change in the
image quality 

TIFF : Tagged Image File Formaty which are mostly used for storing data associated with the picture rather 
than compressing the picture itself and if used for picture compressing it usually uses run-length encoding
