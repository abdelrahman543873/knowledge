the difference between a bridge and a hub is the following
hubs don't know which port is which and they broadcast the message to 
every one

bridges know the mac addresses of devices and only sends the message to a 
specific MAC address

bridges were slow cause they used software for routing that's why they made
ASIC which is a hardware for routIng and it standS for application integrated
specific circuitry and it's A CHIP which allows the cpu of the switch
to be offloaded and makes the processes of the switch faster and easier 
for it 

layer 2 switches learns the mac addresses and puts them into a CAM 
Content Accessible Memory and it's drawn as a horizontal square with arrows inside
and based on that it makes forward decisions

layer3 swtiches has a routing functionality build into it and it looks like
a vertical square box with arrows coming out of it

routers allow for your local network to actually connect to the outer internet
and simply it connects different networks together

there are frequencies in the air and the more the magnitude of the frequency
the more bandwidth (number of devices to connect on this frequency)
and the less range or distance away from the access points you can get

what you have at home now is called an access point not a router

channels are slices or sections of the frequency and the channels 
actually interfere with each other

2.4 ghz frequency has only 3 clean channels 1,6,11 

there is something from cisco that is called wireless controller that
controls wireless access points

WAP Wirless Access Points are drawn like a rectangle that has interfering
waves on it 
and maybe like a square that has a tower and signal to it 

a wirless access points controller is drwan as a rectangle that has 
waves interfering on it and arrows on top of it 

firewalls blocks traffic moving between networks by default but enables 
by exception 

firewalls can be in transparet mode which means that they are installed inside
a local network between routers and they actually filter the data going
inside the network without breaking the network or being detected

firewalls routed mode actually divides networks from each other opposit
to routed mode which is inside a local network 

firewalls has security zones where each zone has a security level
and they do stateful routing which means that high security zones can
speak to low security ones but not vice versa unless the high security 
zone actually asked to communicate with low security ones

IPS intrusion prevention system looks for unusal network behavior and 
blocks it 

routers allows traffic between networks and blocks traffic by exception

network communication is done in terms of bits mean while 
storage is done in terms of bytes

eithernet channelling takes in two or more eithernet cables and combines there
speed 

switches run a portocol called carrier sense multiple acess / collision detector
protocol CSMA/CD

cause access points send signals in the air they don't detect collisions
so they have CSMA/CAvoidance protocol for sending data which means that
every device connected to the access points has to actually wait sometime 
before sending data

MDF Main Distribuation Facility 
IDF Intermediate Distribution facility

two kinds of fiber optic cables 
single mode cables which go for longer distances with a glass core in the cable
multi mode cables which goes for less distances than the SM

for ethernet cables the more twisted the better and they have to be in 
a specific order 

straight through ethernet cables connect different devices together 
throught the fact that the pins at the end of the cable are divided into
recieve and transmit and they are in reversed in the start and the ends of the cable
which allows for any device to reciver and send data

cross over cables connect similar devices togther through aligning the 
recieve and transmit pins togehter at the ends of the calbe

and that categories of cables are on it's way to be gone 
cause there is something in modern cisco equipment that is called 
AUTO MDIX which senses the end of the pins 


types of communication 
Unicast :one to one
multicast:one to many 
broadcast:one to all
anycast : one to closet

ARP Address Resolution protocol and this happens when a device wants to 
connect to another address so it broadcasts a message to everyone on the
server first asking for aspecific ip address AND ARP assigns mac addresses to ip addresses on a local network 
if you type arp -a on the CMD you can find all ip addresses's mac addresses

ip 192.168.1.1
subnet mask 255.255.255.0
then that means that this ip address has the first three octets(parts) 
representing a network and the last octet representing the host range

Network definition is a group of devices that are grouped together 
under the in the same ip address network octet part as defined by 
the subnet mask 

Networks are classes and are classfied acording their size using the 
subnet mask 
a class c network has 254 devices and has a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0
a class b network has 65.536 deivces and has a subnet mask of 255.255.0.0

Gw gate way addres is the default address of the router that allows any
device in the network to communicate to another device in another network
so all devices in a network have on GW

NAT network address translation is the regulator of private and public
addresses 



the internet packet consists of the following
source ip address "the address of my pc"
destination ip address "the website i am going to "
source MAC  "my pc MAC"
destination MAC "my router MAC"

tracert -d website name : allows you to trace where your packet is going

MACs are used for networks hop by hop communication while ip addresses are used for 
end to end communication 

TCP transimition control protocol which ensures packets aren't dropped 
between sources and destination and it's reliable way of communication

UDP User Datagram Protocol doesn't ensure packet arrival to the destination
and is used for real time communcation things like games and calls 

Tcp is a reliable connection protocol and it uses three way hand shake 
to initiate any session so 

my pc send a syn "syncronisation" msg to a server which include my first sequence number let's say 1000

server replies with a syn/akc msg which has a syn of the choice of the server let's say 4000
and an akc that notifies my pc that it recieved my packet which is 1001

then my pc sends an ACK with number 4001 so that it notifies the server
that it's ready to communicate with the server 

Tcp sliding windows is why your pc start slow and then it becomes fast when 
downlaodin a file cause it first sends a very small packet to test the 
server cabapility to actually send and recieve data and at first 
the test packet is very small so when your pc calcualtes the time it 
actually takes to send data it's very huge but then the actuall packet 
data transfer gets bigger and your overall tranfser rate gets highter'

ICMP internet control message protocal and that is the 
protocol used for pinging

first 6 digits in a mac address is the vendor id 

port of https 443

Ping is an icmp protocl msg

APPLICATION layer is responsible for generating requests that the user 
wants to do 

PRESENTATION layer is responsible for standardizing the request into a 
more standard form like formatting the request into an html , jpeg request
simply so that any machine can understand your request 

session:is used for sessioning data into different categories

TRANSPORT layer has the protocols that are used for communication by the 
application layer and decides the ports used for each request 

netstat is used for detecting the ports that are used for communication 
on my pc and it's a windows cmd command

NETWORK layer has the ip address to do end to end communication 

DATA LINK layer has the mac addresses to do hop to hop communication 

physical layer is where data is converted to zeroes and ones to move through
the cable 

the whole osi model process is called the encapsulation process

the tcp/ip model consists of application layer , transport ,internet , network access layer

we have a senario where the application layer is chrome 
then the following steps happen 
1- transport layer adds the protocol that's going to be used which is
for example tcp and then it adds the source and destination port 
where the source port is my pc itself and destination port is the servers
service that i am going to be using in this case for http 80
2- network layer then adds the ip source which is my pc and the destination
ip which is the server 
3- data link layer then adds the mac address which is responsible for hop
by hop communication  and it actually has another future which is the 
cheksum of the data where it adds some number in the data 
and then if the server recieves it , it inputs the data in an equation and
if the output of the equation is = to the number on the packet then it's not
corrupted data
4- the physical layer which converts everything in binary ones and zeroes
ALL OF THIS IS CALLED ENCAPSULATION 

UDP stands for User Datagram Protocol

IOS internet operating system is platform specific and memory requirement
specific

enable commmand on ios changes the mode from user mode to privilage mode 

conf t command changes the mode to global mode

line change the mode to line mode where you can set password for the 
access to your router 

in order to be able to go to global mode you have to pass by limited
and privilage mode first 

you can go back a mode by typing EXIT

you can drop all the levels by typing end or ctrl+z

if you print ? you can see all the commands that you can type

show ip interface brief : shows you all the modes in you routers

no ' any command' : defaults any command after it 

any modem goes through the following stages when booting up 
post which is the process to check on the hardware of the cisco syste
ios decomposing process where it loads the ios on the premanent memory of 
the cisco device 

space scrolls down the page 

if you type part of the command followed by a ? then it's going to show 
you all the commands that start with this letter
and if you type the ? at any place in the command it tells you the rest of it 

the TAB key continues your commmand on the ios 

up and down shows commands like linux

show history : shows you all the comands that you typed before 

ctrl + a : goes to the start of the command 
ctrl + e : goes to the end of the command

reload in 5 : is a command that reboots the cisco device after 5 minutes
which allows you to restore the original config even if you typed something
that disconnected you from the router 

reload cancel : cancells the reload in command 

show running-config : shows you what is the current config of the system 

NVRAM : non volatile random access memory 

copy running-config startup-config : copies the config that you have in the
terminal now into startup config so when the device boots it load the
start-up config 

wr : is the same as copy running-config startup-config

wirte erase : resets the cisco device to it's original settings 

enable secret cisco : this puts a password on the privilage mode which 
is cisco 

if you would like to compleltely change the running config then you should
copy a configuration from an tftp server into the NVRAM and then reboot
the device and then it will load the config from the nvram 

banner motd ! : shows you a login message when you enter the router 


password blabla 
login
this locks the device on future access and requires a passcode to enter 
the device 

line con 0
logging synchronous
this allows you to type you commands on a single line and doesn't allow 
the interference of system messages with your commands 

ip address 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.0 
this sets your ip address to the address shown 

ip address dhcp 
this allows the assigning of your ip address using dynamic host config
protocol

ip domain-lookup 
is actually the cisco device that you have ,,,searching for whatever you 
type that's not a command on dns SO 

no ip domain-lookup 
negates that 

service password-encryption : this changes all the passwords to type 7 
encrypted password so that when someone types 
show running-config , they can't see the passwords you assigned 

enable secret yourpass : creates a password that encrypts the passwords 
in type 5 encryption which allows it to be more secure 


telnet isn't secure , it actually sends and recieves paackets in plain text

FQDN : Fully Qualified Domain Name is actually when the website address
is constructed of www.thewebsitename 

ip domain-name cbtnuggets.com : assigns a domain name of cbtnuggets.com
which the device's keys are associated with , cause every device has got
it's own encryption keys so we have to refrence them using domain names
and that's all for the ssh connection to be established

transport input : is for defining which protocols are going to be allowed
to be passed in the ports 

show ip interface brief : shows you which interfaces are connected to the 
cisco device that you are using and what are their status

CAM : content Accessible memory where the router stores all of it's learned
mac addresses

packet : is the data type at layer 3 "networking"
frame : is the data type at layer 2 "data link layer" 

switches has a 5 minute CAM table and then it resets the CAM table and 
learns the mac addresses of the device again 

if the device is talking to the switch then the switch keeps reseting 
the 5 minute timer preventing the mac address of the talking device from
being deleted 

we don't use hubs anymore it's because they have only one collision domain
which means that every device that wants to send anything has to wait and 
see if there is any other device speaking or not 

in swtiches we have the CAM which allows us to know the mac address of every 
device connnected to the switch which allows for minimal collision and 
other benefit is that we have collision domains on every port of the switch
which means that every device in the network can send and recive data the 
same time 

show mac address-table : shows all the mac addresses of a switch 

show mac address-table| include anything : allows you to find the 
anything from the address table quickly 

show cdp neighbors : shows you all the devices connected to your switch 

interface fa2/0/45 : if you type this it allows you to deal directly with 
this port so if you type shutdown after this command it's like unplugging
the device from the port 

username abdelerahman secret abdoul : this creates a user name and pass
for the ssh channel 

crypto key generate rsa : this generates the keys for the ssh and it must
be proceeded with ip domain-name 

login local : to actually use the usernama and pass you created

interface fastEthernet 2/0/1 
speed 100 
duplex full 
this sets the port to be full duplex which allows it to send and recieve
data at the same time 

if you hardcode a port in a switch to have 100/full duplex 
then you must do the same to the device connected to that port 
cause if it's set to auto then it's going to default to 100 /half duplex


for security limit the number of mac addresses accessing the port 
or hardcode the mac address that is going to access each port 

if port security broke then it's going to protect , restrict or shutdown
where in protecting it's going to allow only the devices specified 
, restrict is the as protect but with notification 
, shutdown shuts down the port 

interface fastEthernet 0/1
switch port-securtiy maxmimum 2
this allows only two mac addresses on each port 

switch port-security violation shutdown 
this shuts down the port on violation 

show : before commands to show you commands status 

switchport port-security mac-address sticky : remembers a mac address
for the port 

show interface fastEthernet 0/5 : show you all the details about this port

when you type the command show iterface focus on the input errors and 
CRCs

CRCs are terminators of each packet and if you see a lot of those that 
means that there is something wrong with the cable or the port 

collisons : this numbers increases if you have the port and the device 
connected to that port different in duplex and speed settings 

late collisions : this happens when the fast ethernet 
cable length is above 100 meters 

VLANs : Virtual Local Area Network is for dividing the ports of the 
switches into groups to make it faster and more secure and each group of 
ports has it's own subnet and they allow you to do QOS

TRUNKS : are the ports that aren't parts of the VLANs and are used to 
extend networks and connect switches togehter

access ports : are ports that can only access one vlan network 

DTP : Dynamic Trunking Protocol , which dynamically detects if the connected device 
is a switch or a computer and based on that determines the type of the port 

switchport mode access/trunk: allows you to change the port to be a trunk or access 

native VLAN : is the default VLAN for packets without tags on it to tell it which VLAN 
it belongs to 

CDP : is a message broadcasted by cisco devices showing their ios and thir device type 
to neighbouring devices 

VTP : Vlan Trunking Protocol it replicates the Vlans in one switch to the others 
and it has something called VTP domain which is the vtp protocol name 
and there are three vtp modes which are client , server and transparent 
where transparent is the equivelant of "off" , and server means that every switch can 
modify the vtp database , and client don't have the permissions of vtp server


show ip route : shows you the routing table of a router 

ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 192.168.1.1 : is for creating a default routing table to get 
to any network availble through 192.168.1.1 router gate way  


802.1Q : is a trunking protocol that is used today 

ROAS : Router On A Stick which is used for routing between vlans

interface fastEthernet 0/2
switchport mode access
switchport access vlan 51
those commands allows the access of ports to only vlan 51

show vlan : shows your vlan configuration 

encapsulation dot1Q 51 : if you want to configure a router to respond to 
packets that are coming from vlan 51 and that majorly happens when you 
are on a sub interface 

interface fastEthernet 0/0.51 : that creates a sub interface 51 

tracert -d ip address : is a windows command to trace route of 
a ping 

conf t
vlan 51
name hello 
exit
this creates vlan 51 with name hello 

SVI : Switch Virtual interface , which is an imaginary interface in the 
switch that responds to layer 3 traffic 

ip routing : is a switch command that turns on the SVI 

interface vlan 51 
ip address 125.100.1.1 
that assigns an ip address to the vlan 51 which allows all the ports on this
vlan to access the network through the ip

pool of ip addresses : in Dhcp you can have a pool of ip addresses whatever
range you want , let's say  100 ip addresses 

ip dhcp excluded-address 10.1.52.1 10.1.52.19
ip dhcp excluded-address 10.1.52.100 10.1.52.255
ip dhcp pool VLAN 52
network 10.1.52.0/24
dafault-router 10.1.52.1
dns-server 4.2.2.2 8.8.8.8
what those commands do is that it creates a dhcp server and it follows
the the following steps 
a:it excludes specific addresses from 10.1.52.1 to 10.1.52.19 so that 
they won't be give by the router to any devices on the vlan
b:it excludes address from 10.1.52.100 and above 
c:it enters the configuration mode of the dhcp server on the router 
for vlan 52 and then the next command is assigining the vlan 
ip to be 10.1.52.0/24 
d:it's assigning the default gateaway for the network to be the router
e:assigning dns servers 

ipconfig /renew : this asks for a new ip address "cmd command"

ipconfig /release : this releases the ip address allocated to the device 

DHCP relay : is what the router does when it recives a broadcast and where
it sends this broadcast to and the command for it is 
ip helper 10.1.52.200 which means that the router will be sending broadcasts
to this address

each class of ip address wether it's class a ,b,c has a standard 
private ip address range for example class c private address range is 
192.168.1.0

subnetting is used for reducing the waste of ip addresses when creating 
a network 

when subnetting you change the subnet into binary and take the last 
bit of the network bits and make it your increment 
so of example if we have more three bits for the network then 
the increment is going to be 32 and then if you have the address 
216.21.5.0 as your first network then the second network is 215.21.5.32 
and so on and all the addresses between those two are devices 

VLSM : Variable Length Subnet Mask  which is bassically changing the 
subnet mask according to the network needs
