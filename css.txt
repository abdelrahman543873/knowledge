css: is short for Cascading Style Sheets , and cascading means having multiple rules for the same element

css latest version is version 3

inline styling : having the style attribute in the html element and customizing the css properties of the element

css declaration: defining what you want to style and how you want to style it 

font-family : css property that changes the font family of the text 
sans-serif: font will use the browser default

class selectors: allow you to choose all elements with a certain class to apply a certain style 
universal selector : is a selector that is used to style all the elements on the page and is done like this 
*{
	color : blue; 
}
id selector : selects an element using the id like this 
#elementId 
attribute selectors : you select all the elements with certain attributes like this 
[attribute]{
	color: blue
}

css is case insensitive so name your classes like this 
class-name

the order matters in css if you define the same selector twice cause the latest selector is applied

inline styles have the highest priority 

specificity: means that the more specific the selector , the higher priority it has  
and the priority list goes from top to bottom as following 
inline styles
id 
classes , :pseudo classes and attribute selectors
combinator
tags and pseudo element selectors

inheritance : in css elements inherit styles from their direct and indirect parent elements 

combinator types: 
ADJACENT SIBLING
example div + p {}
the element "p in this case" has to be a direct sibling of the related element "div in this case" , meaning that the p must come directly after the div
and they both elements has to share the same parents too
GENERAL SIBLING
example div ~ p {}
it's same as the adjacent sibling but the p element doesn't have to come directly after the div  
CHILD COMBINATOR
div > p {}
the child element has to be a direct child , in the example case the p has to be the direct child of div 
DESCENDANT 
div p {}
a generic approach of the CHILD COMBINATOR , all the elements that are under a div get the styling 
it doesn't matter if it's a direct child or not 

value types : 
PREDEFINED OPTIONS:
example: 
display:block
COLORS: 
example:
color: red
LENGTH,SIZE,NUMBER:
examples: 
height: 100px
FUNCTIONS:
examples : 
background : url()

css rule : is the definition of what to style and how to style it 

inheritance has very low specificity and priority 

css property : inherit  : is a css property that allows you to inherit a certain value of a css property 

combinator : allows mixing multiple css selectors together like this 
#someId .className : this is saying to css select any element with class name className inside of an element with id someId 

box model : content is inside padding that is inside border that is inside margin 

css shorthands : combining values of multiple properties in a single property 

order doesn't matter in css shorthands

margin shorthand : margin top bottom right left  or margin : top&bottom left&right like this "margin 5px 10px" 
or margin top&bottom&left&right like this  margin: "10px"
example : margin 5px 10px 5px 10px 

there is by default a margin of 8px in the body 

margin collapsing : is when two elements have a certain margin , and those two elements are next to each other 
the bigger margin always wins and the two margins between the two elements are combined into one 

you can remove the margin collapsing phenomenon by specifying margin top and margin bottom  

block level elements take up 100% width by default 

margin and border and padding are added to the height set of the element cause the height is set for the content of the element

box-sizing : content-box : this is the default behavior of setting the height and width , they are set to the content box only not to the overall html box 

box-sizing : border-box : this now makes height and width include the border 

block level elements has box-sizing value by default to be content-box 

BEM Block Element Modifier : which is a way of writing css classes names

display property allows changing the nature of the element from inline to block and vice versa 

display : none doesn't remove the element from the dom , it just hides it 

display: inline-block : this allows us to use the behavior of both inline elements in terms of the space they take and the block elements in case of the box model of
margin and padding and so on 

visibility:  hidden : this will hide an element but keep it's position 

value: calc(4-1): calc function is a css function that allows calculation of maths operations 

text-decoration: none : this removes any text decoration like links decoration

vertical-align : aligns two elements on the same line 
example : vertical-align:middle

pseudo classes : are classes that are indicating certain state of an element

pseudo elements: defines the style of a specific part of an element 
example : ::first-letter : allows you to style the first letter of an element 

rules grouping : .class1, .class2{
	something
} : this will apply the same rules to both classes 

url() : css function that allows you to reference urls 
example : background: url()
