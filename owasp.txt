security misconfiguration : wrong configuration that could leave apps exposed like leaving default password for a db user

sensitive data exposed : when data is exposed form a system and it's not encrypted

insufficient attack protection: is when an application is being attacked and has no idea that it's being attacked

CSRF Cross Site Request Forgery : where logging into one website could lead to unwanted actions in another website where the user is authenticated

using components with known vulnerabilities 

unprotected APIs

xml external entities : when an xml document refers to another xml within the xml entity and that reference causes the vulnerability

insecure deserialization : serialization is the storage of the data in a store like a db , deserialization is the retrieval of the data from the store
an attacker could modify the data during serialization 

insufficient logging and monitoring : not being able to discover or locate an attack when it happens 

cryptographic failures: causes communication between different parts to be exposed

insecure design : a failure to implement security to design layers that affects integrity , availability and confidentiality 

software and data integrity failure : a software that relies on data from a third party but the third party got corrupted or compromised 

server side request forgery : when a malicious code from the malicious user is executed on the server 
injection : is when malicious code is sent to the server and is executed successfully and this code allows for malicious attacks 

broken authentication and session management : is when an attacker could impersonate someone else through a broken authentication system 

cross site scripting attack : is where a malicious script is executed on the browser of the victim and there is two types of xss attack 
persistent xss attack : is where there is malicious code that is stored on the server side 
non persistent xss attack : is where a link is sent to the user and the user clicks it and then the malicious code is executed to get tokens or hijack sessions 

broken access control : means broken authorization and an authenticated user could do whatever they want once they are logged in

security misconfiguration : which mean incorrect configuration of a system like leaving the default password of a db

STRIDE stands for 
Spoofing : where someone pretends they are someone they aren't
Tampering : meaning manipulation with data 
Repudiation : backing down from a transaction that could happen 
Information disclosure : where Information is being shared out with other users 
Denial Of Service : where fake users attack a server with excessive load  
Elevation of Privilege: where a user elevates his permissions to another level
